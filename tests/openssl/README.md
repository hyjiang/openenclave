OpenSSL tests
=============

This directory includes the unit tests from OpenSSL (under `openssl/test`). The tests are partitioned
into three categories as follows.

* tests.supported.buildtest - The tests generated by the openssl/test/generate_buildtest.pl script.
* tests.supported - The rest of tests that are supported by OE.
* tests.unsupported - The tests that are currently not supported by OE.

The `test_data` directory includes a subset of files required by the tests. These files are required
to have LF the line break type. Because we include the OpenSSL as a git submodule to which the .gitattribute
does not apply, those files end up having CRLF on Windows. As a workaround, we maintain a copy of them
such that we can enforce the LF line break type.
